Function
========

def name(args):
#
# Block
#
    return res # OR return [a,b,...]

Call: 
f1, f2, ... = fct_name(args)

> varargin: *params
> Variables defined outside of the function scope are global
> Variables defined inside  of the function scope are local
> global variables are protected from local variables with the same name
> As soon as an instruction for a variable arises in a function, it becomes local. Statements containing the variable in the 
  function declaration prior to this instruction are automatically "alienated" from the "global" declaration. 
> using keyword "global" in function enables manipulation of variable from outside function scope. (Discouraged approach)

    Recursive Function/Recursion

      The deeper we go in the recursion, the more we add on the stack. When reading it: FILO (First in, last out)

Types and Conversions
=====================

    list     
    ----

        array. Access: my_list[i][j]...
        Read mxn Matrix: A = [[int(j) for j in input().split()] for i in range(m)]

    Set
    ---

        Equivalent to mathematics: (unordered) assembly of unique elements or unmutable types.
        Can perform standard operations (union, intersection, difference)
        Definition: S = {...} or S = set(...)
        E.g. S = set('hello') = {'h','e','l','o'}

        A | B:  A.union(B), Returns a set which is the union of sets A and B.
        A |= B: A.update(B), Adds all elements of array B to the set A.
        A & B:  A.intersection(B), Returns a set which is the intersection of sets A and B.
        A &= B: A.intersection_update(B), Leaves in the set A only items that belong to the set B.
        A - B:  A.difference(B), Returns the set difference of A and B (the elements included in A, but not included in B).
        A -= B: A.difference_update(B), Removes all elements of B from the set A.
        A ^ B:  A.symmetric_difference(B), Returns the symmetric difference of sets A and B (the elements belonging to either A or B, but not to both sets simultaneously).
        A ^= B: A.symmetric_difference_update(B), Writes in A the symmetric difference of sets A and B.
        A <= B: A.issubset(B), Returns true if A is a subset of B.
        A >= B: A.issuperset(B), Returns true if B is a subset of A.
        A < B:  Equivalent to A <= B and A != B
        A > B:  Equivalent to A >= B and A != B 

        Add elements: S.add(elements) or S.update(elements)
tuple 
dictionary
int
float
string


convert list of ints to string: print(' '.join(map(str, list_of_ints))) 

Slices
------
a[start:end] # items start through end-1
a[start:]    # items start through the rest of the array
a[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1
a[:]         # a copy of the whole array
a[start:end:step] # every step item from start to end

a[-1]    # last item in the array
a[-2:]   # last two items in the array
a[:-2]   # everything except the last two items

Similarly, step may be a negative number:

a[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed
a[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed
a[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed
a[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed
