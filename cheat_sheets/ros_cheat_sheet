roslaunch/launchfiles
---------------------

> output = screen : redirects msgs from ~/.ros/log to screen for that node
> roslaunch --screen pkg launchfile: as above but for all nodes
> required = "true" : if this node gets cancelled, all others will too
> respawn  = "true" : if this node gets cancelled, it is respawned


> ros::init_options::Anonymousname: allows running multiple instances
guaranteeing unique names. 
    > overwritten by the name tag in a roslaunch file
> launch-prefix= "cmd prefix": a command that is written into bash before
launching. if launch-prefix = "xterm -e", a separate terminal is launched,
enabling separate in/output console for that node
    > Other inputs are "gdb" for debugging or "nice" to set runtime priority
> ns = "namespace name": pushes node into "namespace name"

> Remapping of topic names
<node>
 <remap from="old name" to= "new name">
</node>

Note: Relative names, not global! I.e. do not prepend /
(alternatively on command line: rosrun <pkg> <node> <old_topic_name>:=<new>
